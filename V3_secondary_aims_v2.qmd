## ADHD dataset variable descriptions

#### Baseline covariates:

-   `ID` subject identifier

-   `odd` Oppositional Defiant Disorder diagnosis, reflecting whether the child was (coded as 1) or was not (coded as 0) diagnosed with ODD before the first-stage intervention.

-   `severity` ADHD score, reflecting ADHD symptoms at the end of the previous school year (larger values reflect greater symptoms). Range 0-10.

-   `priormed` medication prior to first-stage intervention, reflecting whether the child did (coded as 1) or did not (coded as 0) receive medication during the previous school year.

-   `race` white (coded 1) versus non-white (coded 0).

#### Intermediate covariates:

-   `R` response status. R = 0 if child was classified as non-responder to first stage intervention, R= 1 if they were classified as a responder.

-   `NRtime` months at which child was classified as non-responder. Range 2-8. Undefined for responders.

-   `adherence` adherence to the stage 1 intervention. Reflecting whether the child did (coded as 1) or did not (coded as 0) show high adherence to initial treatment.

#### Treatments:

We use effect coding (sum to zero) to denote the two levels of treatment assignment. The primary benefit of effect coding is that we get interpretable estimates of both the main effects and interactions. WHY DO WE EFFECT CODE?

-   `A1` stage 1 treatment assignment. Randomized with probability $0.5$ to Medication (MED, $A1=-1$) or Behavioral Intervention (BMOD, $A1=1$).

-   `A2` stage 2 treatment assignment for non-responders. Non-responders we randomized with probability $0.5$ to receive Augmented (AUG, $A2=-1$) or Intensified (INT, $A2=1$) care. Undefined for responders.

#### Outcomes

-   `Y0` baseline school performance (higher values reflect better performance).

-   `Y1` mid-year school performance.

-   `Y2` end-of-year school performance.

```

## Clean/transform data

Here we grand mean center the baseline covariates. Does not change the point estimates, but is useful when interpreting model coefficients or hand coding contrasts.

```{r}
# Grand mean center all baseline covariates, append '_c' for centered
dat_adhd_c <- dat_adhd %>% mutate(odd_c = odd - mean(odd),
                          severity_c = severity - mean(severity),
                          priormed_c = priormed - mean(priormed),
                          race_c = race - mean(race))
```

# Moderators of stage 2 treatment

A common secondary aim is to learn whether we can use baseline or intermediate covariates to select an optimal second-stage tactic for **non-responders.** For example, whether covariates such as the initial treatment $A_1$ and adherence to initial treatment `adherence` moderate the effect of $A2$.

> We hypothesize that for children who are non-adherent to first-stage treatment it will be better to AUGment ($A2=-1$) with the alternative treatment as opposed to INTensifying ($A2=1$) the current treatment.

## Regression model

We test this secondary aim by fitting a **moderated regression model** using data from non-responders. The model examines whether binary intermediate outcome variable `adherence` and first-stage treatment $A_1$ moderate the effect of second-stage treatment $A_2$ on end-of-year outcome $Y_2$, controlling for other baseline covariates $\mathbf{X}$. The model is as follows:

$$
\begin{gather*} 
E[Y \mid \mathbf{X}, A_1, \text{adherence}, A_2, R = 0] = \eta_0 + \eta^T\mathbf{X} + \eta_1 A_{1} + \eta_2\text{adherence} + \beta_1 A_2 + \\ 
\beta_2 (A_2 \times A_1) + \beta_{3} (A_2 \times \text{adherence})
\end{gather*}
$$

::: callout-important
We interact $A_2$ with the uncentered variable `adherence` since we are interested in the effect of $A2$ at the each of the two levels; adherent (0) and non-adherent (1).
:::

First, subset data.frame to non-responders $(R=0)$

```{r}
dat_adhd_nr <- subset(dat_adhd, R == 0) # subset data.frame to non-responders

head(dat_adhd_nr)
```

Next, fit a moderated regression to the subset of non-responders. Interact $A_2$ with $A_1$ and `adherence`

```{r}
# geeglm fits a Generalize Estimating Equation. Similar to lm(), but gives us robust standard errors.

mod2 <- geepack::geeglm(Y2 ~ odd + severity + priormed + race + 
                          A1*A2 + adherence*A2, 
                        id = ID, 
                        data = dat_adhd_nr)

summary(mod2)
```

\
This regression model gives the effect of $A2$ among non-responders. Looking at the output we find that `adherence` is a significant moderator of stage 2 treatment, but $A_1$ is not.

::: callout-warning
Only the second-stage coefficients $\beta$ from the moderated regression are causal. The first-stage coefficients $\eta$ are biased as a result of sub-setting to non-responders.
:::

## Marginal means of stage 2

We will use a very powerful package called `emmeans` to estimate the marginal mean of end-of-year school performance under different treatment/covariate options. We could do this by writing custom contrasts of the model coefficients, but `emmeans` does this for us.

::: callout-note
Marginal means refers to estimating the expected value while holding some covariates constant and average over the rest.
:::

```{r}
# We use the moderated regression model fit to estimate the average effect of second-stage treatments conditional on levels of adherence. 
# The formula notation denotes the mean outcome under all combination of the factors A1, A2, given levels of adherence.
# We specify weights=proportional since we want to average over the observed distribution of the other baseline covariates.
# df of Inf indicates CIs are computed using the standard normal distribution

em2 <- emmeans::emmeans(mod2, ~ A1 + A2 | adherence, weights = "proportional")
print(em2)
```

The results from the moderated regression and the estimate marginal means suggest that for those children who are non-adherent (`adherence` = 0) it is better to Augment ($A2 = -1$) rather than intensify. Likewise, for those children that are adherent (`adherence` = 1) it is better to Intensify ($A2=1$). Notice, our optimal tactic does not depend on first-stage treatment $A1$.

## Interaction plot of stage 2

We can also use the `emmeans` package to visualize the estimated mean outcome for non-responders under each tactic.

```{r}
ep2 <- emmeans::emmip(em2,  A1*A2 ~ adherence, style = "factor") # Interaction plot for trace.factors ~ x.factors
```

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Show the code"

# Prettify the plot
ep2$data %>% mutate(across(1:3, as.factor)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(xvar, yvar, color = A2, linetype = A1, group = tvar)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point() +
  scale_color_manual("A2", values = c("-1" = "darkgreen", "1" = "purple"), 
                     labels = c("-1" = "-1 AUG", "1" = "1 INT")) +
  scale_linetype_manual("A1", values = c("-1" = 1,"1" = 6), 
                        labels = c("-1" = "-1 MED", "1" = "1 BMOD")) +
  labs(title = "Moderator analysis of stage 2 intervention options",
       x = "Adherence to stage 1",
       y = "EOS School Performance \n (higher is better)") +
  scale_x_discrete(labels = c("Non-adherent", "Adherent")) +
  theme_classic()
```

### Questions

1.  Why do we subset to non-responders when fitting a second-stage moderated regression

2.  What is the optimal tactic for non-adhering, non-responders to BMOD(1)? To MED(-1)?

3.  $A1$ was found to not be useful for tailoring, do we still include it in the regression model?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Q-learning

We just found that `adherence` is useful for tailoring the second-stage tactic. We would like to do something similar and learn first-stage tailoring variables. Can't we just repeat, and taken together, we have a proposal for a more deeply-tailored AI? The answer is no! These separate regressions don't "talk" to each other. That is, we want to make the optimal first-stage decision accounting for the fact we will be making an optimal second-stage decision.

To estimate the effect of a more deeply-tailored adaptive intervention combining the optimal tactics at each stage we use Q-learning.

Estimation has three steps:

1.  Fit stage 2 moderator regression (`mod2`!) ✅
2.  Predict the outcome under the optimal decision rule: $\hat{Y}^{opt}_i$
3.  Fit stage 1 moderator regression on $\hat{Y}^{opt}_i$

## Predict optimal outcome

Learned optimal second-stage tactic:

$$
A2 = \begin{cases} 
1 & \text{ if } \text{ adherent} = 1 \\
-1 & \text{ if } \text{ adherent} = 0 
\end{cases}
$$

Create new data.frame with optimal $A2_i$ for every non-responding child

```{r}
# Assign optimal second-stage tactic
dat_adhd_nr_opt <- dat_adhd_nr %>% 
  mutate(A2 = if_else(adherence == 1, 1, -1))
```

Predict expected outcome under optimal treatment assignment

```{r}
dat_adhd_nr_opt$Y2_opt <- predict(mod2, newdata = dat_adhd_nr_opt)
```

Merge non-responders with the observed outcome for responders

```{r}
# Responders get assigned their observed outcome (no stage2 tactic)
dat_adhd_r <- dat_adhd %>% filter(R == 1) %>%
  mutate(Y2_opt = Y2)

# combine non-responders w/ responders
dat_adhd_opt <- bind_rows(dat_adhd_nr_opt, dat_adhd_r)
```

## Fit stage 1 regression controlling for optimal second-stage

Now we fit a moderated regression model for the first-stage treatment on the `dat_adhd_opt` data.frame, which controls for the optimal second-stage tactic!. The tailoring variable of interest is `priormed`.

$$
\begin{gather}
E[\hat{Y}^{opt} \mid \mathbf{X}, \text{priormed}, A_1] = \eta_0 + 
\eta^TX + \beta_1\text{priormed} + 
\beta_2A_1 + \beta_3(A_1 \times \text{priormed})
\end{gather}
$$

```{r}
# Moderator regression for first stage tailoring on priormed, controlling for optimal future tactic
Qmod1 <- geepack::geeglm(Y2_opt ~ odd + severity + race + A1*priormed,
                         id = ID,
                         data = dat_adhd_opt)

summary(Qmod1)
```

::: callout-warning
The standard errors here are incorrect due to estimating $\hat{Y}^{opt}$. We need special software (see `qlaci`) to do proper inference.
:::

We can use `emmeans` to estimate the expected end-of-year school performance for an adaptive intervention that offers BMOD(1) vs. MED(-1) at first-stage for levels of `priormed`, adjusting for the fact we are optimally tailoring second-stage treatment for non-responders on `adherence`.

```{r}
qem1 <- emmeans::emmeans(Qmod1, ~ A1 | priormed, weights = "proportional")
summary(qem1, infer = FALSE)
```

## Interaction plot of optimal tactic

```{r}
# Interaction plot of A1 with priormed
qep1 <- emmeans::emmip(Qmod1, A1 ~ priormed, style = "factor", weights = "proportional")
```

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Show the code"

# Prettify plot  
qep1$data %>% mutate(across(1:2, as.factor)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(xvar, yvar, color = A1, group = tvar)) +
  geom_line(linewidth = 1) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_color_manual("A1", values = c("-1" = "red", "1" = "blue"), 
                     labels = c("-1" = "-1 MED", "1" = "1 BMOD")) +
  theme_classic() +
  labs(title = "Moderator of stage 1 controlling for optimal stage 2",
       x = "Medication use in Prior year",
       y = "EOS School Performance \n (higher is better)") +
  scale_x_discrete(labels = c("No prior med", "Prior med")) +
  scale_y_continuous(n.breaks = 8)
```

### Estimated mean under optimal more deeply-tailored AI

```{r}
# Assign optimal second-stage tactic
dat_adhd_opt1 <- dat_adhd %>% 
  mutate(A1 = if_else(priormed == 1, -1, 1))

# Predict outcome under optimal treatment a2
dat_adhd_opt1$Y2_opt <- predict(Qmod1, newdata = dat_adhd_opt1)

mean(dat_adhd_opt1$Y2_opt)
```

# The `qlaci` package

The `qlaci` package performs Q-learning on data arising from a two-stage SMART. It is useful for when we want standard errors for the estimates of our more deeply-tailored adaptive intervention.

::: callout-note
The qlaci package can be downloaded from the d3c github: [d3center-isr/qlaci](https://github.com/d3center-isr/qlaci)
:::

First, we specify the contrast matrix that will be used for the stage-1 regression (step 3 of Q-learning). `qlaci()` uses this matrix to estimate the mean outcomes under each of the first-stage treatments (averaging over the future optimal response) at both levels of `priormed`. We also specify a contrast that estimates the mean outcome if everyone in the study had received the optimal more deeply-tailored AI.

```{r}
pPM <- mean(dat_adhd_c$priormed) # probability of priormed

## contrast matrix - we must transpose this for qlaci
c1 <-
  rbind(
    "Mean Y under bmod, prior med"          = c(1, rep(0, 3), 1,  1,  1),
    "Mean Y under med, prior med"           = c(1, rep(0, 3), 1, -1, -1),
    "Mean diff (bmod-med) for prior med"    = c(0, rep(0, 3), 0,  2,  2),
    "Mean Y under bmod, no prior med"       = c(1, rep(0, 3), 0,  1,  0),
    "Mean Y under med, no prior med"        = c(1, rep(0, 3), 0,  -1, 0),
    "Mean diff (bmod-med) for no prior med" = c(0, rep(0, 3), 0,  2,  0),
    "Mean Y Optimal AI"                    = c(1, rep(0, 3), pPM, 1 -
                                                  2 * pPM, -pPM)
  )
```

## qlaci() parameters

The following are the arguments we need to provide to `qlaci()`:

-   `H10`: Baseline covariates we want to adjust for in the first-stage regression.
-   `H11`: Variables that interact with first-stage treatment in the first-stage regression (candidate variables for deeper tailoring).
-   `A1`: Indicator for first-stage treatment
-   `Y1`: A continuous intermediate outcome. Here, we don't have an intermediate outcome, so we set this to zero for everyone.
-   `H20`: A matrix, with each column containing data for a main-effects term in the second-stage regression (analogous to `H10`).
-   `H21`: Variables that interact with second-stage treatment `A2` in the second-stage regression (candidate variables for deeper tailoring).
-   `A2`: Indicator for second-stage treatment
-   `Y2`: End-of-study outcome
-   `S`: Indicator for whether an individual was re-randomized (1 = re-randomized; 0 = otherwise)
-   `c1`: Contrast matrix for first-stage regression (see above)
:::

```{r}
attach(dat_adhd_c) # with attach we can be lazy and refer to variables in the data.frame by name directly

q1 <-  qlaci::qlaci(H10 = cbind(1, odd_c, severity_c, race_c, priormed),
                   H11 = cbind(A1 = 1, "A1:priormed" = priormed),
                   A1 = A1,
                   Y1 = rep(0, nrow(dat_adhd_c)), # set to zero for everyone; we care only about EOS outcome
                   H20 = cbind(1, odd_c, severity_c, race_c, priormed, A1, adherence),
                   H21 = cbind(A2 = 1, "A2:A1" = A1, "A2:adherence" = adherence),
                   A2 = A2,
                   Y2 = Y2,
                   S = 1 - R,
                   c1 = t(c1))

detach(dat_adhd_c)
```

## qlaci results

The the coefficients estimated by `qlaci()` combined with the user specified contrast matrix give us the estimated means for first-stage treatment options by levels of `priormed,` accounting for the optimal second-stage tactic for non-responders. With valid confidence intervals we can test contrasts and even compare the the 4 embedded adaptive interventions.

1.  Why do we need to use Q-learning to estimate a more deeply-tailored AI? What is wrong with simply running two moderator regressions?
2.  Looking at the above table, what do the two contrasts (bmod - med) for levels of prior med tell us about tailoring?
3.  Write the decision rules corresponding to the more deeply-tailored AI.
